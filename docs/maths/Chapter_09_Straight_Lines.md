# Chapter 9: Straight Lines - Important Questions

## 1 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Find the slope of the line passing through the points (3, -2) and (-1, 4).
   **Answer:** $m = \frac{4 - (-2)}{-1 - 3} = \frac{6}{-4} = -\frac{3}{2}$.
2. **Question:** Find the distance of the point (3, -5) from the line $3x - 4y - 26 = 0$.
   **Answer:** $d = \frac{|3(3) - 4(-5) - 26|}{\sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2}} = \frac{|9 + 20 - 26|}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$.

1. **Question:** Find the equation of the line perpendicular to the line $x - 2y + 3 = 0$ and passing through (1, -2).
   **Answer:** Slope of given line is $1/2$. Slope of perpendicular is $-2$. Eq: $y - (-2) = -2(x - 1) \implies 2x + y = 0$.

## 3 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Find the equation of the line passing through the point of intersection of the lines $4x + 7y - 3 = 0$ and $2x - 3y + 1 = 0$ that has equal intercepts on the axes.
   **Answer:** Intersection pt: $(1/13, 5/13)$. Equal intercepts $\implies m = -1$. Eq: $13x + 13y = 6$.

## 5 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Find the image of the point (3, 8) with respect to the line $x + 3y = 7$ assuming the line to be a plane mirror.
   **Answer:** Let image be $(h, k)$. Midpoint lies on line, and slope of line joining points is perpendicular.
   $\frac{h-3}{1} = \frac{k-8}{3} = -2 \frac{1(3) + 3(8) - 7}{1^2 + 3^2}$.
   Solving gives image $(-1, -4)$.
