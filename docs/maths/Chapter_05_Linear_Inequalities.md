# Chapter 5: Linear Inequalities - Important Questions

## 1 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Solve $3x - 2 < 2x + 1$.
   **Answer:** $x < 3$
2. **Question:** Solve $-12x > 30$ when $x$ is a natural number.
   **Answer:** No solution (since $x < -2.5$ and natural numbers are positive).

## 2 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Solve the inequality $3(2 - x) \ge 2(1 - x)$.
   **Answer:** $x \le 4$. Solution set: $(-\infty, 4]$

## 3 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Solve the system of inequalities graphically: $x + y \ge 5$, $x - y \le 3$.
   **Answer:** (Graph required showing the common shaded region satisfying both conditions).
2. **Question:** A manufacturer has 600 litres of a 12% solution of acid. How many litres of a 30% acid solution must be added to it so that acid content in the resulting mixture will be more than 15% but less than 18%?
   **Answer:** More than 120 litres but less than 300 litres.

## 5 Mark Questions
