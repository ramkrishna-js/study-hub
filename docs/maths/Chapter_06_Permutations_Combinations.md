1. **Question:** Find the number of arrangements of the letters of the word INDEPENDENCE. In how many of these do the words start with P?
   **Answer:** Total arrangements = $\frac{12!}{3!4!2!}$. Starting with P = $\frac{11!}{3!4!2!} = 138,600$.
2. **Question:** How many words, with or without meaning, can be formed using all the letters of the word EQUATION at a time so that the vowels and consonants occur together?
   **Answer:** Vowels (E,U,A,I,O) = 5, Consonants (Q,T,N) = 3. Treat vowels as one block and consonants as one block? Or vowels together and consonants together?
   Usually "vowels occur together": Consider (EUAIO) as 1 unit + Q, T, N = 4 units. $4! \times 5! = 24 \times 120 = 2880$.
