# Chapter 8: Sequences & Series - Important Questions

## 1 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Find the 10th term of the GP: 5, 25, 125, ...
   **Answer:** $a=5, r=5$. $a_{10} = ar^9 = 5 \cdot 5^9 = 5^{10}$.

## 2 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Insert 3 numbers between 1 and 256 so that the resulting sequence is a G.P.
   **Answer:** $1, g_1, g_2, g_3, 256$. $ar^4 = 256 \implies r^4 = 256 \implies r=4$. Numbers are 4, 16, 64.

## 3 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** The sum of first three terms of a G.P. is $\frac{13}{12}$ and their product is -1. Find the common ratio and the terms.
   **Answer:** Let terms be $a/r, a, ar$. Product = $a^3 = -1 \implies a=-1$. Sum: $-\frac{1}{r} - 1 - r = \frac{13}{12}$. Solve quadratic for $r$: $r = -3/4$ or $-4/3$. Terms: $4/3, -1, 3/4$ or $3/4, -1, 4/3$.

## 5 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** Find the sum to n terms of the series: $5 + 55 + 555 + \dots$
   **Answer:** $S_n = \frac{5}{9} [ (10-1) + (100-1) + \dots + (10^n-1) ] = \frac{5}{9} [ \frac{10(10^n-1)}{9} - n ] = \frac{50}{81}(10^n - 1) - \frac{5n}{9}$.
