# Chapter 14: Probability - Important Questions

## 1 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** A coin is tossed twice, what is the probability that at least one tail occurs?
   **Answer:** Sample space {HH, HT, TH, TT}. Fav: {HT, TH, TT}. $P(E) = 3/4$.
2. **Question:** If P(A) = 3/5 and P(B) = 1/5, find P(A or B) if A and B are mutually exclusive.
   **Answer:** $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 3/5 + 1/5 = 4/5$.

1. **Question:** Two dice are thrown. The events A, B and C are as follows:
   A: getting an even number on the first die.
   B: getting an odd number on the first die.
   C: getting the sum of the numbers on the dice $\le 5$.
   Describe the event: A and B.
   **Answer:** A and B means "Even on 1st AND Odd on 1st". This is impossible. $A \cap B = \phi$.

1. **Question:** A committee of two persons is selected from two men and two women. What is the probability that the committee will have (a) no man? (b) one man? (c) two men?
   **Answer:** Total ways $^{4}C_2 = 6$. (a) $^{2}C_2/6 = 1/6$. (b) $(^{2}C_1 \times ^{2}C_1)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3$. (c) $^{2}C_2/6 = 1/6$.

## 5 Mark Questions
1. **Question:** If E and F are events such that $P(E) = 1/4$, $P(F) = 1/2$ and $P(E \text{ and } F) = 1/8$, find:
   (i) $P(E \text{ or } F)$
   (ii) $P(\text{not } E \text{ and not } F)$
   **Answer:** (i) $1/4 + 1/2 - 1/8 = 5/8$. (ii) $P(E' \cap F') = P((E \cup F)') = 1 - P(E \cup F) = 1 - 5/8 = 3/8$.
