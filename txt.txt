1. If I Was a Tree (Mudnakudu Chinnaswamy)
This poem is a biting critique of the caste system and the practice of untouchability.
The Core Idea: The poet wishes to be a tree because nature does not discriminate.
Key Imagery: * The bird doesn't ask the tree's caste before building a nest.
The sun and rain embrace the tree without feeling "defiled."
The "Sacred Cow" (representing traditional religious structures) would still rub against it, and the "three hundred thousand gods" inside her would touch the tree.
Conclusion: The poet suggests that only in death (being burned in a holy fire or becoming a bier) can a person from a lower caste finally achieve a "pure" status in the eyes of society.
2. The Farmer’s Wife (Volga)
A feminist perspective on the agrarian crisis and farmer suicides.
The Conflict: The husband committed suicide to escape the "virtuous" debt he couldn't pay, leaving the wife to deal with the creditors and the "sin" of surviving.
Key Contrast: The husband is "virtuous" because he is gone; the wife is a "sinner" because she remains.
The Turning Point: She realizes that while he saw the "harvest of the crop" (money) destroyed, she must protect the "harvest of her womb" (their children).
Message: It is a poem of survival and struggle over the "cowardice" of death.
3. An Old Woman (Arun Kolatkar)
Set in the temple town of Jejuri, this poem explores human value and resilience.
The Encounter: An old beggar woman pestering a tourist for a fifty-paise coin to take him to the horseshoe shrine.
The Shift: The tourist initially feels annoyed and wants to end the "farce," but when he looks into her eyes—described as "bullet holes"—his perspective shatters.
The Realization: He sees the cracks in her skin mirrored in the cracking hills and temples. He realizes that she is the only thing "shatterproof" while he is reduced to "small change" in her hand.
Do Not Ask of Me, My Love (Faiz Ahmed Faiz)
This poem marks the transition of the poet from a singer of romantic love to a voice for the oppressed and the suffering masses.
The Core Idea: The poet tells his beloved that he can no longer offer her his undivided, youthful devotion because he has become aware of the immense physical agony and social injustice in the world.
The Conflict: The "illusion" of a perfect, private romance vs. the "dark and brutal curses" of systemic poverty and disease.
Key Imagery:
The Past: "Bright, young, and blooming" life where the beloved’s beauty controlled the seasons (Spring).
The Present: Graphic descriptions of "bodies bathed in blood," "festering sores," and "pus dripping"—contrasting the beauty of the woman with the ugliness of human misery.
The Commodity: Bodies being "sold from market-place to market-place," highlighting exploitation and slavery.
The Turning Point: The refrain: "For there are other sorrows in the world than love, and other pleasures, too." He acknowledges that while she is still beautiful, he is "helpless" to ignore the rest of the world.
Conclusion: The poet rejects the selfishness of "pure" romance in a world of suffering. He argues that a poet’s duty is to turn their eyes toward the truth, even if that truth is painful and unromantic.
